# **Identification of extreme outliers**

### This repository makes the databases and coding (R) available for extreme outlier detection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The theoretical details of the proposed method, procedures, and workflow will be found in the article submitted for evaluation in Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence ([EAAI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-applications-of-artificial-intelligence)) - Elsevier.

## Repository Structure

- Code (files):
  * `ExtremeOutliers.R`: Main function of the detection's extreme outlier;
  * `ExtremeOutliers_Test.R`: Test the main function in different TDBs.
- TemporalDataBase: The temporal databases used in the simulations. 

## How to Use

1. Clone or Download this repository. 

2. [Optional] Check the source function in the file `ExtremeOutliers.R` to understand the arguments and the return of the function.  

3. Run the file `ExtremeOutliers_Test.R` in the RStudio environment to check the use of functions and get the results. 

## Requirements

- The implementation of the methods is done in R Code, using the package `readr`.
- All the tests are created by RStudio.
